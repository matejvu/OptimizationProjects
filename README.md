This repo represents a collection of implementations for many optimization algorithms.
Most of the algorithms are applied to different, real life, problems.
<br>
Each directory contains a README with a description, accuracy and results section.
Additionally, some README files will contain directions(e.g. correct sequence of program execution in order to get desired plots).
