Description:
<br> &emsp;Using the Brent's method for finding the maxima of $|\underline{F}_s|$ for characteristic equation of antenna radiation given below.
<br> &emsp; $\underline{F}_s = \sum^{n-1}_k e^{-jk\phi},$ &emsp; $\phi=\delta+\beta d\cos\theta$
<br>Accuracy:
<br> &emsp; Result of the maxima is found with the error of order $10^{-7}$.
<BR>Results:
<br> &emsp;delta = 4.712388971753841
<br> &emsp; $max(|\underline{F}_s|)$ = 5.999999999999999
