Description: <br> &emsp; Implementation of Genetic Algorithm with high mutation probability is used to detemrmine the optimal way to pack files into 2 large directories. The one-point crossover was used as a breeding mechanisam since this problem classifies as SAT. 
<br>Directions:
<br> &emsp; When running the main.cpp code, 20 data.txt files and a minimumValue file are generated.
The data files are used by GeneticAlgorithm.py to plot graphs.
The images grafik1 and grafik2 are examples of the resulting graphs.
Accuracy: <br> &emsp; Population size is 20 000 and there is 50 generations.
<br>Results: <br> &emsp; One example was chosen: &emsp; Sample[2101222211110221111212102110111002120010011112200100110102002212].
<br> &emsp; Each file(by order) is given status: 0-no dir, 1-first dir, 2-second dir
<br> &emsp; Empty space in both directories: 397B
