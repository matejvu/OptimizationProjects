Description: <br> &emsp;
Implemented PSO algorithm for the purpouse of finding the minimal length of wires needed to properly 
connect all important dots in an airplane with the introduction of two movable dots. Problem is given in three dimensional Cartesian coordinates.
<br>Accuracy: <br> &emsp; Distance between the best particle and all others needs to be less than $10^{-3}$.
<br>Results: 
<br> &emsp; Length of wires: 17.568749
<br> &emsp; Location of the movable dots:
<br> &emsp; &emsp; (2.33564617, 4.47080565, 0.75720072)
<br> &emsp; &emsp; (5.40055224, 5.46972021, 3.59500787)
